Batch scripts to monitor server
This set of batch scripts was initially from midgetgrimm at https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/31262-simple-server-monitorrestart/

I have added arma server monitor as well, thanks to fred41 https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/146822-arma-server-monitor-very-small-but-useful/ for a great tool, he unfortunately has terminated the project.

I have just added my own variables so a person can just enter fields within the batch files.
